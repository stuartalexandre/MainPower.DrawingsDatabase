<h1 style="color:red;">IMPORTANT FOR ALL DATABASE WRITERS:</h1>
The drawings database uses a two part index to find a drawing from AutoCAD when doing a get/put command, using a combination of the drawing number and sheet number.  It is very important that once a drawing is in the database, that the drawing number or sheet number is not changed, otherwise the link between the title block and the database record will be broken.  If the drawing number or sheet number must be changed, then change both the title block and the database separately.
