<h1>Using the AutoCAD Interface</h1>
<b>Note:</b>  Before you can use the AutoCAD interface, you must first install the AutoCAD plugin.  You can do this by selecting Tasks->AutoCAD Plugin from the Drawings Database program.
<br/>
<br />
You can update drawing title blocks from the database and vice-versa using the AutoCAD interface to the database, which is implemented via the AutoCadPlugin.dll file.  The plugin exposes the following functions to AutoCAD:
<ul>
	<li>ddbget - Pull data from the database into a selected block</li>
	<li>ddbgetd - Pull data from the database into all blocks in the drawing</li>
	<li>ddbgetl - Pull data from the database into all blocks in the current layout</li>
	<li>ddbput - Put data from the selected block into the database</li>
	<li>ddbputd - Put data from all the blocks in the drawing into the database</li>
	<li>ddbputl - Put data from all the blocks in the current layout into the database</li>
	<li>ddbsettings - Edit various settings used by the library</li>
	<li>ddbsearch - Show the search and editing dialog for the database</li>
	<li>ddbabout - Shows the about information dialog</li>
	<li>ddbadd - Manually add a drawing into the database</li>
	<li>ddbmorerev - Shift the revisions down so that b revision occupies a  revision and so on (a drops off the bottom and is lost)</li>
	<li>ddbnum - Autonumber a title block and save</li>
	<li>ddbedit - Opens a dialog allowing editing of drawing attributes, the saves to the database and updates the title block.</li>
	<li>ddbversion - Prints the database version</li>
    <li>ddblink - Creates an entry in the database for open drawing, fills out the filename automatically but nothing else.&nbsp; (Designed for drawings with non standard title blocks)</li>
    <li>ddbrevab - Add revision lebelled AS BUILT.&nbsp; Will ask for drawn/approved initials.</li>
    <li>ddbrevifc - Add revision labelled ISSUED FOR CONSTRUCTION.&nbsp; Will ask for drawn/approved initials.</li>
